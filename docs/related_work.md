This project implements and validates the topological sigma-bond counting rule
σ = T + R − φ and is inspired by the preprint:

Mishra, A. G. (2024). *Sigma Bond Calculation via Euler's Formula for Planar and Polyhedral Molecular Graphs*. Research Square. DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-7340867/v1.

The preprint formalizes the rule for connected genus-0 molecular graphs and validates it on a curated set of molecules. See the preprint for proofs, sample calculations, and license (CC BY 4.0).
